To help you practice using Maven with the Spring Petclinic project, I can guide you through setting up the project on GitHub. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Fork the Spring Petclinic Repository
1. **Go to the [Spring Petclinic GitHub repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)**.
2. Click on the **Fork** button on the top right to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository using the following command (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-petclinic.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spring-petclinic
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Maven
1. Ensure you have Maven installed. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   mvn -v
   ```
   If Maven is not installed, follow the [Maven installation guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

### Step 4: Build the Project with Maven
1. In the root directory of your project, run the following command to package the project:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```
2. Maven will compile the project, run tests, and create a package (usually a `.jar` or `.war` file depending on the project).

### Step 5: Run the Application
1. After packaging, you can run the application using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub
1. After making any changes, add, commit, and push them to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Maven package setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

Now your Spring Petclinic project is on GitHub, and youâ€™ve practiced using Maven to package the project. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
